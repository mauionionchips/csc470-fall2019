    //Physics engine doesnt allow two colliders volumes to overlap. When the physics engine detects that two or more colliders were overlaped that fram, the physics object would look the object and analyse the speed,rotation and shape, and calculate a collision. One of the major facts in the calculation is whether the colliders are static or dynamic. Static colliders are usually non-moving parts of your scene, like the walls, the floors. Dynamic colliders are things that move, like the player's sphere or car. When calculating a collision, the setic geometry will not be affected by the collision, but the dynamic object will be. In our case, the player's sphere is dynamic while moving geometry. It is bouncing off the static geometry of the cubes, just as it bounces off the static geometry of the walls.
    //...The physics engine can however allow the penetration or overlap of collider volumes. When it does this, the physics engine still calculates the collider volumes who keeps track of the collider overlap, But it deosnt physically add on the overlapping objects. It doesnt cause collision. 
    //...We do this by making our colliders triggers or trigger colliders. When we make our colliders into a trigger or trigger collider, we can detact the context of that trigger through the OntriggerEvent messagers. 
    //...When a collider is a trigger, you can do clever things like place a trigger in the middle of doorway inside a ... game. And when the player enters the trigger, the minimap updates and the message displays you have discovered this room.
    //...We are using OnTriggerEnter in our code rather than OnCollisionEnter, so we need to change our collider volumes into trigger volumes.
    //...Look at the prehab asset and the box collider component, tick the "Is Trigger"
    //Unity expects us to move colliders with simply indicating unity which colliders are dynamic before we move them. 
    //...We use this by using the rigidbody component. Any gameobject with a collider and a rigidbody is considered dynamic. Without rigidbody, static.
    // So, static collider(deosnt move) shouldn't move(like walls and floors), dynamic colliders can move(have rigidbody attached). Standard rigidbody are moved using physic forces. Kinematic rigidbody are moved using their transform.
