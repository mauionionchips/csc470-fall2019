# Final Game: "Spend Bill Gates' Money"

## Game Overview
The game will ask player's help to spend two of the richest people in the world's money, who are Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Whoever can spend their money within two minutes wins the game.
The visual and audio style of this game are intended to be absurd. This game will include one player starting from Bill Gates's "land" (ground), which will have a user interface of a "shop interface". At this shop, the player can see the money Bill Gates has left while they spending by buying different amount of different goods. When the user has spent all of Bill Gates's money within two minutes, the player can jump to another platform, which is Jeff Bezos's "land". And do the same thing to Jeff Bezos. If the player could not spend both of their money within two minutes, they lose the game by seeing the text "You failed to help Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to spend their money!".
